                Dear Daddy, no matter where I go in life, youâ€™ll always be my number one man. In the darkest days, when I feel inadequate, unloved and unworthy, I remember whose daughter I am and I straighten my crown. It was you who taught me to value myself.

            <p>
                You brought me every single toy that I wanted when I was young. I hope I can return the favor when I grow up by achieving every single goal that you always wanted me to. You have seen me at my worst, yet you think that I am the best. I love you Dad.

                I am a princess not because I have a prince, but because my father is a king. You told me that I was uncommonly beautiful and that I was the most precious thing in his life.
